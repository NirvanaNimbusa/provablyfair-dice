# Provably Fair Dice

A Go implementation of the [provably fair dice algorithm](http://dicesites.com/provably-fair). It can be used as either a client that verifies dice roles or as a server which generates them.

It is essentialy just a fair random number generator which generates numbers within the range [0, 100]. It could be used for games more advanced than dice such as Blackjack, Roulette, etc.
